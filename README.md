The Servo Dependency Tool is a set of python scripts that automatically upgrades Cargo dependencies for the Servo web browser engine (Github page: https://github.com/servo/servo).

## Background Information
[Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) is a prototype web browser engine written in the Rust language. It is currently developed on 64bit OS X, 64bit Linux, and Android. Servo depends on numerous other Rust libraries that are published on [the package manager crates.io](https://crates.io/). There are no notifications for when packages are updated; it's up to developers to keep track of when they need to upgrade their dependencies.
